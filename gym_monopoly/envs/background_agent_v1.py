"""
All external decision_agent functions must have the exact signatures we have indicated in this document. Beyond
that, we impose no restrictions (you can make the decision agent as complex as you like (including maintaining state),
and we use good faith to ensure you do not manipulate the gameboard. We will have mechanisms to check for inadvertent
changes or inconsistencies that get introduced in the gameboard (due to any reason, including possible subtle errors
in the simulator itself) a short while later.

If you decision agent does maintain state, or some kind of global data structure, please be careful when assigning the
same decision agent (as we do) to each player. We do provide some basic state to you already via 'code' in the make_*_move
functions. Specifically, if code is 1 it means the 'previous' move selected by the player was successful,
and if -1 it means it was unsuccessful. code of -1 is usually returned when an allowable move is invoked with parameters
that preempt the action from happening e.g., the player may decide to mortgage property that is already mortgaged,
which will return the failure code of -1 when the game actually tries to mortgage the property in action_choices.

Be careful to note what each function is supposed to return in addition to adhering to the expected signature. The examples
here are good guides.

Your functions can be called whatever you like, but the keys in decision_agent_methods should not be changed. The
respective functions must adhere in their signatures to the examples here. The agent in this file is simple and rule-based,
 rather than adaptive but capable of taking good actions in a number of eventualities.
 We detail the logic behind each decision in a separate document. This is the agent that will serve as the 'background'
 agent for purposes of evaluation.
